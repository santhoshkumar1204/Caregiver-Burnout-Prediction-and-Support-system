## 🎯 Problem Statement
Caregivers frequently experience prolonged emotional, physical, and mental stress.  
Traditional support systems are mostly reactive and lack structured early burnout detection tools.

This leads to:

- Reduced care quality  
- Emotional exhaustion  
- Increased caregiver attrition  
- Poor mental health outcomes  

**HoldOn addresses this gap through predictive monitoring and timely support activation.**
